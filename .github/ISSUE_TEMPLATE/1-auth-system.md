## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive authentication and authorization system to secure the application and manage user access.

### Key Features
- [ ] User registration with email verification
- [ ] Secure login with JWT tokens
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] OAuth integration (Google, Apple)
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)

### Technical Requirements
- Implement JWT token-based authentication
- Set up secure password hashing
- Create middleware for route protection
- Implement refresh token mechanism
- Set up email verification service
- Configure OAuth providers
- Implement rate limiting

### Security Considerations
- Password complexity requirements
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Secure session handling

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean login/registration forms
- Password strength indicator
- Clear error messages
- Loading states for auth actions
- Responsive design for all auth pages
- Intuitive navigation flow

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for auth functions
- Integration tests for auth flow
- Security penetration testing
- Performance testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Documentation Needs
- API documentation
- Security best practices
- User guide for auth features
- Integration guide for OAuth

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can register with email verification
2. Users can log in securely
3. Password reset works reliably
4. OAuth providers are properly integrated
5. Role-based access is enforced
6. 2FA works as expected
7. All security measures are implemented
8. Tests pass with good coverage
